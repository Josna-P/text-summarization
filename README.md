This project fine-tunes the google/pegasus-samsum model to perform abstractive text summarization on conversational data using the SAMSum dataset. It leverages Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers and Datasets libraries, and supports model training, evaluation, and saving for future use.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
Uses the Pegasus model (pretrained for summarization).

Trains on SAMSum: real-life dialog-summary pairs.

Implements Hugging Face's Trainer API for training.

Saves the fine-tuned model and tokenizer for inference.
